  description: > 
    This dataset captures the natural degradation of plastic threads over repeated 
    use. We conducted 25 screw driving experiments without any manipulations, using 
    two screws per workpiece across 25 repetitions, resulting in 5,000 total observations. 
    Rather than introducing artificial defects, we allowed the natural degradation 
    process to occur as threads were repeatedly cut into the plastic workpiece components, 
    providing realistic wear patterns.
  purpose: > 
    To analyze how thread quality naturally degrades through repeated use cycles, 
    establishing baseline degradation patterns for quality control and predictive 
    maintenance applications.
