  description: >
    This dataset investigates how variations in injection molding parameters affect screw driving 
    performance in plastic housing assemblies. We systematically modified production parameters 
    of the lower workpiece including cooling time, mold temperature, glass fiber content, switching point,
    and injection velocity. These variations simulate real-world manufacturing fluctuations and material
    batch changes commonly encountered in production environments. The dataset includes 7482 total
    observations across 44 distinct experimental conditions.
  purpose: >
    To analyze how injection molding parameter variations impact screw driving metrics, providing 
    insights for quality control measures in plastic component production and assembly processes,
    as well as the detectability of material and process variations through fastening data analysis.
